## ​Chapter 4 – Machine Learning

* What is machine learning, according to this chapter, and how does it differ from traditional rule-based programming?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Machine learning allows computers to learn patterns from data instead of relying on explicitly programmed rules. Definition on Wikipedia.
</details>

* Why is learning from examples useful in situations where writing explicit rules is difficult?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Because some problems are too complex or variable to be solved using hand-written rules, but examples allow patterns to be learned automatically.
</details>

* What is the purpose of training data in machine learning?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Training data is used to teach the model patterns and relationships in the data.
</details>

* Why must test data be kept separate from training data?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

To evaluate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
</details>

* What is meant by a feature, and why are features important?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

A feature is a measurable property of the data, and features determine what information the model can learn from.
</details>

* What is a label, and in which type of learning is it used?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

A label is the correct output associated with an example and is used in supervised learning.
</details>

* How does supervised learning differ from unsupervised learning?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>
Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning finds patterns without predefined labels.
</details>

* Give an example of a problem that fits supervised learning and one that fits unsupervised learning, based on the chapter.

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

* Supervised learning: predicting whether an email is spam.
* Unsupervised learning: grouping similar data points without labels.
</details>

* What does generalization mean in machine learning?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Generalization means that a model performs well on new, unseen data.
</details>

* Why is generalization more important than performance on training data?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Because machine learning systems are used on future data, not just the data they were trained on.
</details>

* What is overfitting, and how does it occur?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too precisely, including noise instead of general patterns.
</details>

* Why is overfitting undesirable in real-world applications?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Because it reduces performance and reliability on new data.
</details>

* How does model complexity relate to overfitting?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

More complex models are more likely to overfit, especially when training data is limited.
</details>

* According to the chapter, why does having more data often help machine learning models?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

More data helps models learn true patterns rather than noise.
</details>

* Why does more data not always guarantee better performance?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

If the data is biased, low quality, or unrepresentative, predictions can still be poor.
</details>

* What can happen if a model is evaluated using the same data it was trained on?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

The model’s performance will appear better than it actually is, giving misleading results.
</details>

* Why does the chapter emphasize that machine learning predictions are never guaranteed to be correct?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>
Because predictions are based on patterns in data, not certainty.
</details>

* How does the quality of data affect machine learning outcomes?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Poor-quality or biased data can lead to inaccurate or unfair predictions.
</details>

* What role do humans play in designing and evaluating machine learning systems?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Humans choose the data, features, goals, and evaluation methods.
