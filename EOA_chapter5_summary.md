## Chapter 5 – Neural Networks

* What made neural networks practical and successful in recent years?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Neural networks became practical because of increased computing power and the availability of large amounts of data, which are both needed to train them effectively.
</details>

* What is the core idea behind neural networks?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

The core idea is that many simple computational units can be combined so that complex behavior emerges from their interaction.
</details>

* How are neural networks inspired by the human brain?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Neural networks are loosely inspired by biological neurons in the brain, where signals are combined and passed forward, but they are much simpler and more abstract.
</details>

* What is an artificial neuron and what does it do?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

An artificial neuron takes input values, combines them using weights, and produces an output value.
</details>

* What role do weights play in an artificial neuron?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Weights determine how important each input is when calculating the neuron’s output.
</details>

* Why is a bias included in an artificial neuron?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

A bias allows the output of a neuron to be shifted, making the model more flexible when learning patterns.
</details>

* What is an activation function and why is it needed?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

An activation function determines the output of a neuron and introduces non-linearity, which allows the network to learn more complex patterns.
</details>

* What is meant by a layer in a neural network?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

A layer is a collection of neurons that process information at the same stage in the network.
</details>

* What does it mean for a neural network to be “deep”?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

A neural network is called deep if it has multiple layers stacked on top of each other.
</details>

* At a high level, how does a neural network learn from data?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

A neural network learns by adjusting its weights so that its outputs become closer to the correct answers over time.
</details>

* Why do neural networks typically require large amounts of data?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Neural networks have many weights to learn, and large datasets help them learn meaningful patterns instead of random noise.
</details>

* What types of problems are neural networks particularly well-suited for, according to the chapter?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Neural networks are especially good at tasks like image recognition, speech processing, and language-related problems.
</details>

* Why are simple rules often not enough for problems solved by neural networks?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

These problems are often too complex or variable for hand-written rules, but neural networks can learn patterns directly from examples.
</details>

* How do layers help neural networks learn complex tasks?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Each layer can learn increasingly abstract features, allowing the network to build a complex understanding step by step.
