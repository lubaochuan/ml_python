# Chapter 1: What Is AI?

https://www.elementsofai.com/

## Defining Artificial Intelligence
* Why is it difficult to give a single, universally accepted definition of artificial intelligence?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

There is no official definition; AI is a moving target. As techniques become well understood, they are no longer considered AI. Media, science fiction, and public misuse of the term also contribute to confusion.
Key points: evolving field, no consensus, reclassification over time
</details>

* Explain the joke definition of AI as “cool things that computers can’t do.” What insight does this definition capture, and what are its limitations?
<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

  * Insight: captures how AI shifts as technology advances.
  * Limitations: self-defeating, vague, excludes solved problems, “cool” is subjective.
</details>

* What two key properties are used in the chapter to characterize AI systems?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

  * Autonomy: ability to perform tasks without continuous human control
  * Adaptivity: ability to improve performance by learning from experience
</details>

* Why does the course argue that AI is not a clear yes–no category, but something that can exist in degrees (a “pinch of AI”)?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Many systems involve only a “pinch of AI.” Some parts may be adaptive or autonomous while others are not.
</details>

* Why is it misleading to treat “AI” as a countable noun (for example, saying “an AI”)?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

AI is a scientific discipline, not an object. Better phrasing: “AI methods” or “AI systems.”
</details>

## What Is Easy for Humans vs. Hard for Machines (and Vice Versa)
* Why do tasks such as grasping objects or walking feel easy to humans but are difficult for robots?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

They require perception, coordination, real-time feedback, and skills shaped by millions of years of evolution and years of human learning.
</details>

* Why did early AI researchers focus on tasks like chess and mathematical problem solving?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

These tasks appear intellectually demanding but are rule-based and computationally tractable.
</details>

* What did the Deep Blue vs. Kasparov match reveal about the nature of intelligence in computers?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Computers can outperform humans in narrow, well-defined tasks without general intelligence.
</details>

* What does this comparison between perception tasks and game-playing tasks tell us about human intuition versus machine computation?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Humans excel at perception and physical tasks; machines excel at large-scale, fast computation.
</details>

## Language and Misconceptions About AI
* What are “suitcase words,” and why do words like intelligence, learning, and understanding fall into this category?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Words with many meanings that cause misinterpretation (e.g., intelligence, learning, understanding).
</details>

* Give an example of how using everyday meanings of words like “understanding” can lead to incorrect assumptions about AI systems.

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Saying an AI “understands” images may imply human-like comprehension, which is incorrect.
</details>

* Why does the chapter argue that intelligence is not a single dimension along which AI systems can be ranked?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

AI systems are narrow and incomparable across tasks (e.g., chess vs. spam filtering).
</details>

## Related Fields and Taxonomy
* How is machine learning related to AI, and why is it considered central to modern AI systems?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that enables adaptivity by learning from data.
</details>

* How does deep learning differ from (and relate to) machine learning?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning using complex, multi-layer models.
</details>

* What is data science, and how does it differ from AI even though the two often overlap?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

An umbrella field combining statistics, ML, CS, and domain expertise; often uses some AI but is broader than AI.
</details>

* Why is robotics described as an “ultimate challenge” for AI?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

It combines perception, reasoning, learning, action, and human interaction in real-world environments.
</details>

* Why can machine learning be considered a subfield of both AI and statistics?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

ML overlaps both fields: learning algorithms (AI) and statistical modeling (statistics).
</details>

## Philosophy of AI
* What is the Turing Test, and what was Alan Turing trying to measure with it?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

A machine is intelligent if its behavior (in conversation) is indistinguishable from a human’s.
</details>

* What is a major criticism of the Turing Test discussed in the chapter?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

It measures human-like behavior, not true intelligence or understanding.
</details>

* Summarize the Chinese Room thought experiment. What question about intelligence does it challenge?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

A system can manipulate symbols correctly without understanding their meaning.
</details>

* According to the Chinese Room argument, why might a system behave intelligently without actually “understanding” anything?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Intelligent behavior does not guarantee real understanding or consciousness.
</details>

## Narrow AI vs. General AI
* What is the difference between narrow AI and general AI (AGI)?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

  * Narrow AI: performs one task
  * General AI: can perform any intellectual task (hypothetical)
</details>

* Why does the course state that all current AI systems are examples of narrow AI?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

All existing systems are task-specific and lack general reasoning ability.
</details>

* Why has the pursuit of general AI largely been abandoned by most AI researchers?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Over 50 years of little progress; research success is in narrow AI instead.
</details>

* How does the distinction between strong AI and weak AI relate to philosophical debates about consciousness and intelligence?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

  * Strong AI: genuine mind/consciousness (philosophical)
  * Weak AI: behaves intelligently without consciousness (practical AI)
</details>

## Reflection and Application
* Consider a real-world AI system you use regularly (e.g., navigation, recommendations, chatbots). In what ways is it autonomous? In what ways is it adaptive?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

  * Navigation: autonomous route planning; adaptive traffic prediction.
  * Recommendation systems: adaptive learning from user behavior.
</details>

* Why is it important for non-experts to understand the limits of AI, especially given media and science-fiction portrayals?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Prevents unrealistic expectations, misuse, fear, and misinformation.
</details>

* How does Chapter 1 help you distinguish between realistic AI expectations and science fiction?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>

Chapter emphasizes narrow AI, lack of consciousness, and task-specific intelligence.
